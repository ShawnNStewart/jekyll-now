Data, Data Everywhere

“Journalism in the Age of Data”, published by Geoff McGhee in 2011, presents a look at how data visualization has become incorporated into mainstream journalism and become exponentially more complex over a brief period of time. In a field where software and techniques become outdated very rapidly, this video’s message is still relevant a decade later and still contains important insights for anyone interested in data visualization. In particular, there is a focus on the importance of using data well. Anyone can create a chart, but it takes skill to create a chart that is engaging, easily readable, and tells a story. In a world where more and more data are available every day, it’s important to understand that not all data visualizations are equally useful.  

**A large amount of data does not automatically convey a large amount of information.** It is entirely possible to bring together very large data sets or time series that extend across many years, but unless the visualization is created thoughtfully, the end result may not be coherent or useful. The tricky thing here is that visualizations (especially interactive ones) that use large amounts of data often look very flashy and visually appealing. However, the real test is whether a viewer can “read” the graphic and understand something from it. 

**Data visualization is an expressive language.** As such, it is important to treat it as a language. Leland Wilkinson’s Grammar of Graphics attempts to do exactly that, viewing data visualization as its own language with its own grammatical rules and requirements. In Journalism in the Age of Data, we see an example of one man who has created a graphical, statistical review of his life over the past year. While not everyone will be interested in how many taxi trips one particular person took over the course of a year, it is a good example of how data visualization can be used in many different ways to express many different things. It is not only for large data sets or for certain topics. 

**Data and data visualization have become more accessible.** As government data and other large data repositories become more accessible, and as data visualization software becomes more ubiquitous, the message seems to be “anyone can visualize data.” However, just because a visualization can be created does not mean it is necessarily useful. It takes some amount of familiarity with statistical methods, understanding data generation methods, and base knowledge of the topic at hand to create a solid visualization. It is easy to create bad visualizations that are useless at best or misleading at worst. As the tools to create data visualization become more widespread, it will be even more important for consumers to be data literate so they can distinguish meaningful graphics from those that have fatal flaws.
