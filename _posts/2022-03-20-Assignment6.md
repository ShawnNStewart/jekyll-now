#### Question 1

Look up websites containing the following data representations
a)Using JSON
b)Using XML

Analyze the websites in terms of structure and composition. Name the technology/methods use for creating the web database.

#### Answer

The UT Dallas ISSO webpage uses Amazon Connect to serve live chat functionality. The Amazon Connect instance is configured to store all chat logs in an S3 bucket in Amazon Web Services, and the chat logs are stored as JSON files. Things such as date, agent, and chat text are stored and can be retrieved as needed through the Amazon Connect dashboard by staff members. The Amazon Connect dashboard provides user-friendly access to information stored in the database, and is used by staff members (not students or other clients sending chat messages). For example, through the dashboard a supervisor can pull a list of all chats answered by a particular agent, including their time stamps and chat details, for review. 

The ISSO also uses a database called Sunapsis to manage international student records. Staff members have the ability to use a graphical interface called the "custom report builder" to query the database, and results are returned in XML format. In this database, there is no function within the graphical interface that displays results - the results are always output as an XML formatted file.

#### Answer

**select** *i.id, i.name*

**group by** *i.id, i.deptname*
**having** count(distinct *course_id*) = (
  **select** count(distinct *course_id*)
  **from** *course c* 
  **where** *c.deptname = i.deptname*)
