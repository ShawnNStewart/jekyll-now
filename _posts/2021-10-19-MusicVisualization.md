When we think about data visualization, we don’t often think of music. However, think about the intricate interplay of elements in a classical orchestration. There can be dozens of instruments, all playing different notes at different volumes with different emphasis. Our ears hear the combined, artistic masterpiece but few of us could distinguish each individual instrument and what note they’re playing. 

Data visualization helps us make sense of large, complex, and messy data. The human brain is wired for sight, and we are much better at differentiating things based on sight than on sound. One [YouTube content creator]( https://www.youtube.com/c/smalin/featured) has created dozens of visualizations based on classical music, and the results are visually astounding. Even more, they allow us to see things in the music that may have been impossible to notice otherwise. 

I found the use of color in [this visualization of a Scarlatti sonata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iio6BKQ6GZs) very interesting. The different colors represent tones and harmonies, and as the piece goes on we can see the color palette shift as the key shifts. While our ears are actually very good at picking up on this type of tonal shift, the visualization allows us to see what exactly changed. This also goes beyond what information a layperson could gain from looking at the sheet music arrangement. Although some experienced musicians may be able to look at the notes on the sheet music and imagine exactly how they will sound when played, most of us don’t have that level of expertise. 

There are some other interesting things to notice about this piece. The creator uses circles to represent each note, and we can see the harmonies in the left and right hand of the harpsichordist. Instead of having the notes scroll across the screen evenly, the creator splits some sections into the bars of the music. 

The placement of the circles on the screen (high or low) represents the pitch – whether the note is high or low. The glow of the notes represents whether the note is held, staccato, or connected to the notes that follow (legato). You can see the depth of information available in a simple piece of music. 

While data visualization can offer deep insights, in cases like this, it may be used for artistic or entertainment purposes. Although we can analyze what we’re seeing, it is safe to assume that most people visiting this YouTube channel are looking for entertainment, not a data science lesson. And perhaps the data scientists who stumble across this channel also have a lesson to learn or remember – that data can be beautiful.
