title: R Exercises - Generative Art
---
When most people think of programming, the first thing they think of is not art. However, there is a whole community of artists doing just that - creating art with code. Antonio ChinchÃ³n is one such artist, who hosts the blog [https://fronkonstin.com](https://fronkonstin.com) where he posts his experiments in R. 

Here is an example of Antonio's code experiments, which creates a plot of a delicate tree.

The original R output gives you this image.

We can easily change the color to give it a different look.
