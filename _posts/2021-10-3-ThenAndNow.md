title: Then and Now – Two Approaches to Data Visualization
---
As the fields of data science and the available technology have advanced, visualization of data has become more and more important. While data visualization has always been an important tool for understanding patterns in the data, with the advent of Big Data it is even more essential. We can’t just view the data tables and get anything useful out of that exercise when we have hundreds of thousands (or millions) of rows or data. We must use statistical summaries and exploratory visualization to begin to get a handle on it. 

**But what makes a good graph?**

Statisticians have been arguing over this for centuries, and only recently did we begin to have a comprehensive theory to evaluate the relative merits of different types of graphs and charts. With Leland Wilkinson’s Grammar of Graphics and the application of cognitive science to data science, we begin to have a common understanding through which to understand what makes a chart good (or not). But despite this commonality, different authors still take different approaches. 

**The Cognitive Science Approach**

William Cleveland and Robert McGill conducted experiments in 1984 that laid the groundwork for our understanding of how people interpret graphs and charts. Using experimental methods, they were able to determine how well human eyes interpret different kinds of visual relationships (length, area, volume, and so on). Their paper “Graphical Perception: Theory, Experimentation, and Application to the Development of Graphic Methods” is just as relevant today as it was back in the 1980s. In it, they are not concerned with aesthetics or visual appeal, but rather with how well the human eye (and mind) can extract information from certain kinds of graphics. 

**The Practical Approach**

Decades later, we’re still talking about graphics and data visualization but often in very different ways. Nathan Yau’s book *Visualize This: The Flowingdata Guide to Design, Visualization, And Statistics* does not spend a lot of time going into the theory behind different visualizations. He jumps straight into best practices and practical tips on making effective graphics. His emphasis is on telling stories with data (a more journalistic approach) rather than extracting useful information for scientific purposes from data (which is more in line with Cleveland and McGill’s studies). Yau’s approach is helpful for the lay person who needs to jump into creating decent graphics quickly, but it does not provide the level of detail needed to fully understand why certain types of graphics may work better than others. 

In the end, both publications add something useful to the data visualization discourse. We need to seek out many different approaches and perspectives to be truly great data scientists and to create effective, appealing graphics.
