### More Information

The world is shaped by the stories we tell ourselves. With a background as an English teacher and a BA in Literary Studies, I am excited to apply a story-oriented approach to data analytics. While number crunching is exciting, the way we get actionable results is by understanding the stories the data can tell us. I am currently pursuing my MS in Social Data Analytics at UT Dallas.
